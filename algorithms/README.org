These algorithms are copies of the algorithms found in the [[https://github.com/snowballstem/snowball][snowball package]]. (See [[file:LICENSE][LICENSE]]).
To compile them to rust code yourself, please use the [[https://github.com/JDemler/snowball/tree/fb-rust_support][rust backend]] of the snowball compiler.

This library ships with these algorithms already compiled.
